My Chess Playing Agent is TEXT BASED. 
The Board is represented by an 8  X  8 grid.
The white pieces is the pieces with "small letter" representation of the name of the Chess pieces.
For example, "p" stands for the white pun. "k" stands for the white Knight. "A" (for ACE) stands for the black King.

IT WORKS !!

Thanks
